This project enables extracts the latest NBA Top Shot Moments' data, as well as NBA Stats' data, merges the data with the player's data from FiveThirtyEight (where available), processes the data, and stores the latest data together with the accumulated data from previous extractions.

To run this project, you would need to install the dependencies required by the project that are provided in either of the two virtual environment folders; the "Virtual_Env" folder for Conda or the "nfts_nba_extraction_env" folder for pip.

You can run either the Python notebook "nfts_nba_data_extraction.ipynb" or the Python script "nfts_nba_data_extraction.py" to extract the latest version of the data, and the latest data will be saved in the "accumulated_data folder" together with the accumulated data in one csv file.
